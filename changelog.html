    <h2>Version 1.3.5</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can now register more sets than just default; now 'peaceful', 'easy', 'normal', and 'hard' are valid
            options and will take effect when the singleplayer game/server is set to the associated difficulty level.
            See the sample file for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also add custom sets as well, named anything other than 'default', 'peaceful', 'easy',
            'normal', or 'hard'.  These custom sets can be applied or removed with the /ch applySet setName and
            /ch removeSet setName command.  These could then be associated with command blocks or quest mods that allow
            running commands, or simply run by a server op.

    <ul>

            Logging in multiple times without first closing your game will produce duplicate recipes for all
            added crafting recipes, and generate errors for furnace recipes. While harmless, this is annoying, and
            will be resolved in the next release.
