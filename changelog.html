    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adds in a new '/ch reload' command, which will reload your configs from disk and sync them out
            to all connected players.  Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/7">issue #7</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/6">issue #6</a> where logging in
            repeatedly without first closing your game would cause added recipes to be duplicated.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.2.4</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Client will download configuration from server when connecting.</li>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/5">issue #5</a> where shapeless
            recipes with more than one of the same item would match with only one of the item, instead of all of them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/4">issue #4</a> where users
            couldn't actually specify the recipes they wanted to remove down to a single recipe/category.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Known Issues</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Logging in multiple times without first closing your game will produce duplicate recipes for all
            added crafting recipes, and generate errors for furnace recipes. While harmless, this is annoying, and
            will be resolved in the next release.
        </li>
    </ul>

            removals were being processed before some mods were adding in their recipes and not actually removing anything.

    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding scriptable onCraft function for more advanced things when crafting, such as adding a random chance

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.2.0</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding in support for OnCraft things for shapeless recipes as well.</li>
        <li>
            Updating how shaped recipes return transformed item stacks to be less (not at all?) hacky; should make things
            a lot safer going forward, and seems to fix any lingering issues I was having with it.
        </li>
        <li>Adding progress bars when processing config files, and when initializing and applying operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version 1.1.3</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/1">Issue #1</a> where shaped recipes
            with returnOnCraft would create a phantom item in the crafting grid if the user tried to craft with a stack
            of the item to be returned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/2">Issue #2</a> where shaped recipes
            were having a problem being properly handled by the craft matching code to find special *OnCraft transforms.
        </li>
        <li>Various improvements to how input items were build from their components.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.1.2</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding damageOnCraft (which, coincidentally, could also be 'heal on craft' if you provide a negative damage value).</li>
        <li>Updating to Forge 1863</li>
        <li>Fixing JEI integration on shaped recipes; mostly.  NBT items have some issues; not sure if that's on my end though.</li>
        <li>Fixing ReplaceOnCraft only working when there was one item in the stack.  Thank you ForgeHooks.</li>
