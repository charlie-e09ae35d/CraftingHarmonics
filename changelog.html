    <h2>1.1.3</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/1">Issue #1</a> where shaped recipes
            with returnOnCraft would create a phantom item in the crafting grid if the user tried to craft with a stack
            of the item to be returned.
        </li>
        <li>Various improvements to how input items were build from their components.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.1.2</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding damageOnCraft (which, coincidentally, could also be 'heal on craft' if you provide a negative damage value).</li>
        <li>Updating to Forge 1863</li>
        <li>Fixing JEI integration on shaped recipes; mostly.  NBT items have some issues; not sure if that's on my end though.</li>
        <li>Fixing ReplaceOnCraft only working when there was one item in the stack.  Thank you ForgeHooks.</li>
