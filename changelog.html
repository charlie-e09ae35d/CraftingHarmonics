    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/3">issue #3</a> where recipe
            removals were being processed before some mods were adding in their recipes and not actually removing anything.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.2.2</h2>

    <ul>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.2.1</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding scriptable onCraft function for more advanced things when crafting, such as adding a random chance
            of an item breaking when used in a craft.

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.2.0</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding in support for OnCraft things for shapeless recipes as well.</li>
        <li>
            Updating how shaped recipes return transformed item stacks to be less (not at all?) hacky; should make things
            a lot safer going forward, and seems to fix any lingering issues I was having with it.
        </li>
        <li>Adding progress bars when processing config files, and when initializing and applying operations.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.1.3</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/1">Issue #1</a> where shaped recipes
            with returnOnCraft would create a phantom item in the crafting grid if the user tried to craft with a stack
            of the item to be returned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixes <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/2">Issue #2</a> where shaped recipes
            were having a problem being properly handled by the craft matching code to find special *OnCraft transforms.
        </li>
        <li>Various improvements to how input items were build from their components.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Version 1.1.2</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding damageOnCraft (which, coincidentally, could also be 'heal on craft' if you provide a negative damage value).</li>
        <li>Updating to Forge 1863</li>
        <li>Fixing JEI integration on shaped recipes; mostly.  NBT items have some issues; not sure if that's on my end though.</li>
        <li>Fixing ReplaceOnCraft only working when there was one item in the stack.  Thank you ForgeHooks.</li>
    </ul>
