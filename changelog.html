    <h2>Version 1.4.3</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding entity event support, so that you can apply more generic events entities based on
            the matcher system.  By default, no entities will have events, and all events have to be added
            using the 'addEntityEvent' operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'I:TicksBetweenEntityEvents' which determines the number of seconds
            between the event code running.  By default, this is 5 to help with TPS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added two new scoreboard matchers ('isScore' and 'rangeScore') to allow users to more easily match
            scores.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added an optional 'player' specifier to all scoreboard matchers, which allows the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Not specified / empty string: The current player/entity must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'All': All players must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'AllOnline': All online players must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'Any': Any player must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'AnyOnline': Any online player must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>Any other string: The specified player (or dummy entry) must match the criteria.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Added two additional (optional) parameters for all scoreboard matchers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    defaultValue: If the an entity doesn't have a scoreboard entry, use this value as the default
                    value; this defaults to 0.  This is useful if you need to test within a given range
                    that includes 0, but don't want entities who have no score at all to match.
                </li>
                <li>
                    create: If an entity doesn't have a scoreboard entry, create it if this is flagged as true; this
                    defaults to false.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/88">issue #88</a> where
            matchers were being checked in the opposite order they should've been, causing more expensive
            checks to be run first.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.4.2</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to add/remove recipes from Blood Magic's Alchemy Table using the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>BloodMagic.addAlchemyTable</li>
                <li>BloodMagic.removeAlchemyTable</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'cooldown' matcher for setBlockDrops, setMobDrops, addMobShed, and addMobPotionEffect.
            This will allow you to specify a set number of ticks (minimum) that have to pass between the entry being
            valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'isRaining', 'isStorming', and 'isSnowing' matchers for setBlockDrops, setMobDrops,
            addMobShed, and addMobPotionEffect.  These can be configured not only to check for the presecne of the
            weather in the world, but also if the target is in the right biome, or if the weather is happening at their
            position (ie: not underground when raining).
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'playerHasAchievement', 'minStat', and 'maxStat' matchers for setBlockDrops, setMobDrops,
            addMobShed, and addMobPotionEffect.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding multiple callbacks for addMobPotionEffect operations.  You may now specify a set of events for:
            <ul>
                <li>onNew: When the potion is first applied to the entity by the operation.</li>
                <li>onExtended: When an existing potion's duration is extended by the operation</li>
                <li>
                    onApplied: When either a new potion is applied or the duration is extended by the operation;
                    this is called after onNew/onExtended are called, and is intended for any shared code you would
                    want to run.
                </li>
                <li>onExpired: When the potion created by this operation is removed because its duration is 0 or less.</li>
                <li>onCured: When the potion created by this operation is cured by using a curative item (or through a command).</li>
                <li>
                    onRemoved: When the potion created by this operation is removed by expiring/being cured; this is
                    called after onExpired/onCured are called, and is intended for any shared code you would want to run.
                </li>
            </ul><br />
            Each of these can take an array of callbacks to run when the event occurs.  At current, only two types
            of callbacks are supported:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Running a command: You may run a command by passing in an object that looks like the below<br />
                    <br />
                    <pre>{
    type: "runPlayerCommand",
    command: "/say @p You've got some extra luck.",
    name: "The Server"
}</pre><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Running a JavaScript function: You may also pass in a raw JavaScript function.  The functionality
                    for this is currently limited to logging, but will be expanded in a future release.
                    An example of this would be:<br />
                    <pre>function(entity, world) {
    console.log(entity.getName() + "'s luck expired.");
}</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/68">issue #68</a> where
            many of the drop entries were being duplicated in SSP, because the handlers were being registered on
            both the client and server.

        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/69">issue #69</a> where
            addMobPotionEffect operations weren't getting removed, but re-added.

    <h2>Version 1.4.1</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding mob potion effect support, so that you can apply potion effects to mobs (and players) based on
            the matcher system.  By default, no mobs will have potion effects applied, and all effects have to be added
            using the 'addMobPotionEffect' operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'I:TicksBetweenPotionEffects' which determines the number of seconds
            between the potion effect code running.  By default, this is 5 to help with TPS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new command '/ch getPotions' to list all available potions for use in operations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/54">issue #54</a> where
            ordering of tag lists mattered with fuzzy matchers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/62">issue #62</a> where
            the saved world data was assigning an immutable set where it shouldn't have and causing per-player
            operations (like starter inventory) to fail to realize they'd already been applied.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/65">issue #65</a> where

        </li>
        <li>
            Adding ability to add starter items in base sets (default, peaceful, easy, normal, hard) with the

    <h2>Version 1.3.12</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding mob shedding support.  By default, no mobs will shed, and all sheds have to be added
            using the 'addMobShed' operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'I:SecondsBetweenSheds' which determines the number of seconds

        </li>
        <li>
            Adding block drop controls, much like those used for mob drops; use the 'setBlockDrops' operation.  There's
            a dirty example in the default.json.sample file that shows multiple uses, including the new composite matchers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'B:LogMobDropEvents' which determines if block break events should be logged

        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/52">issue #52</a> where

            <ul>
                <li>
                    hide: Hide an item/block from the JEI list; note that recipes that use the item, or make the item,
                    will still allow players to get to the item, so, if you really want to remove all signs of the item,
                    remember to remove the recipes as well.

        <li>
            Harvest level names can be applied with custom sets as well, so, you could leave a harvest level as
            "Unknown" until the player reaches a certain point in progression where they should be able to mine it;
            optionally combine this with setting harvest levels to ensure the player really doesn't mine it until
            after that point.

        <li>
            You can now register more sets than just default; now 'peaceful', 'easy', 'normal', and 'hard' are valid
            options and will take effect when the singleplayer game/server is set to the associated difficulty level.
            See the sample file for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also add custom sets as well, named anything other than 'default', 'peaceful', 'easy',
            'normal', or 'hard'.  These custom sets can be applied or removed with the /ch applySet setName and
            /ch removeSet setName command.  These could then be associated with command blocks or quest mods that allow
            running commands, or simply run by a server op.
