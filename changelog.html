            when the player right-clicks on a block, including preventing default handling when matched.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to add recipes to Forestry machines with the following operations:

            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/141">issue #141</a> where

        </li>
        <li>
            Updating to the newest version of the Nashorn Scripting Library, so that items that require arrays can be

        <li>
            Adding a new operation 'forceWeather' that can force the weather in a given dimension to be clear,
            rain, or storming while the operation is in effect unless something else overrides it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding a new matcher 'isBurning' to check if the relevant entity is on fire or not.  This will test the
            slain mob for mob drops, and the harvester/target for all others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'onDrop' entity callbacks for block drops, mob drops, and mob sheds.  Use this in order
            to apply a variety of interesting effects when a particular drop is obtained.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.5.1</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding in a way to prevent specific blocks from being placed, or items from being used.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding in item display names to the getResourceLocator and getHeldNBT commands, in order to
            assist in reading the logs later on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding in the 'setLightLevel' operation to set the light level for a given block; this should generally
            only be used in a base set, as blocks must be picked up and placed back down to update their lighting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding int he 'setBlockHardness' operation to set the hardness of individual blocks; unlike the light level
            this can be changed on the fly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new entity callback 'setStepHeight'; this operation will immediately change the entity's step height
            to the given value.<br>
            <i>1.10 note: This will not work for players, due to the changes made for auto-jump.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding a few new matchers to check for the armor value of the respective entity:

                <li>armorMin</li>
                <li>armorMax</li>
                <li>armorRange</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

                <li>Block Drops: Checks the harvester.</li>
                <li>Entity Events/Potions: Checks the target.</li>
                <li>Mob Drops: Checks the mob being killed.</li>
                <li>Mob Sheds: Checks the target mob.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Updating the coremod portion of the mod; this will produce a warning, but will allow it to load between
            versions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/128">issue #128</a> where
            our command handler wasn't properly implementing compareTo, causing a warning when used with HelpFixer.

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.5.0</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may now use .js files as well as .json files in their Sets directory in order to write configuration
            scripts in pure JavaScript instead of using JSON.  Not all operations currently have a JavaScript equivalent,
            especially cross-mod integration, however, the JavaScript system will allow you to also add a JSON object
            directly to a set, so some level of scripting is still applicable to all operations.  See the wiki for more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sample files have been improved some; there's now even a '/ch genSamples' command to regenerate them
            after each version update.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/114">issue #114</a> where
            the weather matchers for blocks weren't properly checking the block above them, and thus, were always false.

        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/123">issue #123</a> where
            tile entity events wouldn't work on servers due to an issue with initializing the tile entity handler.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing an issue where remove operations that were repeatedly applied/removed would end up creating
            duplicate recipes.

            Per <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/111">issue #111</a> I'm adding
            a few extra checks around sky colors to prevent mods from passing in a null entity and causing problems.

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.4.6</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added targeting for use with entity callbacks.  The following targets are available; only one may be specified per callback:
            <ul>
                <li>area: Targets a given area, in meters, around the player</li>
                <li>hostile: As area, but only targeting hostile mobs</li>
                <li>animals: As area, but only targeting animals</li>
                <li>players: As area, but only targeting players</li>
                <li>target: Specify a particular target; currently only 'original' supported, to target the entity that triggered the event</li>
                <li>multitarget: Used to combine any number of the above; also supports matchers.</li>
                <li>except: Can only be used when multitarget is specified; any targets matched here will be taken out of the list. Similarly supports matchers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Added a 'targetEntities' callback for tile entities, will allow for a target modifier (above) to be declared
            and will run a set of entity callbacks on each entity matched by the target modifier.  See the wiki for  more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for Calendar API, and a calendar and temperature system in general,
            with the following matchers, available for most everything:
            <ul>
                <li>calendarIsSeason: Checks to see if it is currently the given season.</li>
                <li>calendarIsDayOfYear: Checks to see if it is currently the given day of the year, based on your config.</li>
                <li>calendarMinDayOfYear: Checks to see if it is currently at least the given day of the yar.</li>
                <li>calendarMaxDayOfYear: Checks to see if it is currently at most the given day of the year.</li>
                <li>temperatureMin: Checks to see if it is at least the given minimum temperature.</li>
                <li>temperatureMax: Checks to see if it is at most the given maximum temperature.</li>
                <li>temperatureInternalMin: Checks to see if an entity has a minimum internal temperature.</li>
                <li>temperatureInternalMax: Checks to see if an entity has a maximum internal temperature.</li>
            </ul><br />
            The last two are not supported by Calendar API, and, as such, will return the same as temperatureMin/Max,
            they are simply in place for mods which do provide a way of tracking and distinguishing such things.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to control Tinker's Construct drying rack recipes with:
            <ul>
                <li>TConstruct.addDryingRecipe</li>
                <li>TConstruct.removeDryingRecipe</li>

            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/107">issue #107</a> where
            the Blood Magic Alchemy Array integration wasn't actually using the proper alchemy circle renderer
            when isBinding was set to true.

<div>
    <h2>Version 1.4.5</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding a new 'addTileEntityEvent' operation, and the ability to perform a (at this time) limited number

        <li>
            Adding support for Botania Unofficial, with the following operations:

        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/97">issue #104</a> where

    <h2>Version 1.4.4</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Added an 'otherwise' parameter to 'setMobDrops', 'setBlockDrops', 'addMobShed', 'addMobPotionEffect', and
            'addEntityEvent' so that, when a match fails, you may set up an alternate drop/potion effect/event.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is useful primarily for replicating drop situations like gravel, where there's an N% chance of finding
                    flint, but it should otherwise drop gravel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each 'otherwise' entry is a full entry in itself, so it can have its own matchers, and its own
                    'otherwise', in case you want to continue chaining them.  Remember that too many chains will
                    begin to impact performance.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Added HQM and Better Questing integration; both use a standard set of matchers/callbacks to promote
            portability between the two mods.  The following matchers are available for 'setMobDrops', 'setBlockDrops',
            'addMobShed', 'addMobPotionEffect', and 'addEntityEvent':
            <ul>
                <li>questingIsHardcore: Takes a single boolean parameter, determining if it should be valid when/when not in hardcore mode</li>
                <li>questingInParty: Takes a single boolean parameter, determining if it should be valid when/when the player is in a party</li>
                <li>questingHasSharedLoot: Takes a single boolean parameter, determining if it should be valid when/when the player's party has shared loot</li>
                <li>questingHasSharedLives: Takes a single boolean parameter, determining if it should be valid when/when the player's party has shared lives</li>
                <li>questingQuestStatus: Matches a given quest's status by its name (must be unique) and status, optionally against Any/All players online.</li>
            </ul><br />
            Additionally, the following callbacks are made available:
            <ul>
                <li>questingGiveLives: Gives the target player/party one or more lives.</li>
                <li>questingTakeLives: Removes one or more lives from the player/party.</li>
                <li>questingCompleteQuest: Completes all objectives for the named quest, and allows the player to claim any rewards.</li>
                <li>questingResetQuest: Resets all objectives for the named quest, requiring completing them again prior to turning in the quest.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Added matcher 'isSleeping' to addMobShed, addMobPotionEffect, and addEntityEvent.  This checks to see if
            the entity in question is a player, and if they are currently in a bed (or not, if set to false).
        </li>
        <li>
            Added an operation 'setSkyColor', as well as callbacks 'setSkyColor' and 'revertSkyColor' in order to
            allow you to change the sky color of a given dimension.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improved how mob and block drops were calculated to ease some of the burden during processing.

        <li>
            Teleport callbacks will actually run some safety checks on the target area prior to teleporting things, by
            default.  Added the optional parameters 'unsafeTeleport' (defaults to false) and 'safeRadius' (defaults to
            5 blocks) to control this functionality.

        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/92">issue #92</a> where
            the 'teleportSpawn' callback was a bit off in doing cross-dimensional teleports.  By a lot.

    <h2>Version 1.4.3</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding entity event support, so that you can apply more generic events entities based on
            the matcher system.  By default, no entities will have events, and all events have to be added
            using the 'addEntityEvent' operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'I:TicksBetweenEntityEvents' which determines the number of seconds
            between the event code running.  By default, this is 5 to help with TPS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added two new scoreboard matchers ('isScore' and 'rangeScore') to allow users to more easily match
            scores.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added an optional 'player' specifier to all scoreboard matchers, which allows the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Not specified / empty string: The current player/entity must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'All': All players must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'AllOnline': All online players must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'Any': Any player must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>'AnyOnline': Any online player must match the criteria.</li>
                <li>Any other string: The specified player (or dummy entry) must match the criteria.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Added two additional (optional) parameters for all scoreboard matchers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    defaultValue: If the an entity doesn't have a scoreboard entry, use this value as the default
                    value; this defaults to 0.  This is useful if you need to test within a given range
                    that includes 0, but don't want entities who have no score at all to match.
                </li>
                <li>
                    create: If an entity doesn't have a scoreboard entry, create it if this is flagged as true; this
                    defaults to false.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Added the 'BloodMagic.addImperfectRitual' operation to allow users to create new imperfect rituals that
            can have callbacks for their effects.  See the wiki for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added initial support for AbyssalCraft with the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>AbyssalCraft.addCrystallization</li>
                <li>AbyssalCraft.removeCrystallization</li>
                <li>AbyssalCraft.addTransmutation</li>
                <li>AbyssalCraft.removeTransmutation</li>
            </ul><br />
            More to come later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added support for a few new bits of top level information for sets:
            <ul>
                <li>duration: A number of ticks for which the set should be applied.</li>
                <li>cooldown: A number of ticks after the set has been removed during which it can't be re-applied.</li>
                <li>removesSets: An array of set names that should be removed when this set is applied.</li>
            </ul><br />
            See 'custom2' in default.json.sample for more details.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/88">issue #88</a> where
            matchers were being checked in the opposite order they should've been, causing more expensive
            checks to be run first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/89">issue #89</a> where
            applied sets were being saved when they shouldn't, and not being saved when they should.

    <h2>Version 1.4.2</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to add/remove recipes from Blood Magic's Alchemy Table using the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>BloodMagic.addAlchemyTable</li>
                <li>BloodMagic.removeAlchemyTable</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'cooldown' matcher for setBlockDrops, setMobDrops, addMobShed, and addMobPotionEffect.
            This will allow you to specify a set number of ticks (minimum) that have to pass between the entry being
            valid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'isRaining', 'isStorming', and 'isSnowing' matchers for setBlockDrops, setMobDrops,
            addMobShed, and addMobPotionEffect.  These can be configured not only to check for the presecne of the
            weather in the world, but also if the target is in the right biome, or if the weather is happening at their
            position (ie: not underground when raining).
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding support for 'playerHasAchievement', 'minStat', and 'maxStat' matchers for setBlockDrops, setMobDrops,
            addMobShed, and addMobPotionEffect.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding multiple callbacks for addMobPotionEffect operations.  You may now specify a set of events for:
            <ul>
                <li>onNew: When the potion is first applied to the entity by the operation.</li>
                <li>onExtended: When an existing potion's duration is extended by the operation</li>
                <li>
                    onApplied: When either a new potion is applied or the duration is extended by the operation;
                    this is called after onNew/onExtended are called, and is intended for any shared code you would
                    want to run.
                </li>
                <li>onExpired: When the potion created by this operation is removed because its duration is 0 or less.</li>
                <li>onCured: When the potion created by this operation is cured by using a curative item (or through a command).</li>
                <li>
                    onRemoved: When the potion created by this operation is removed by expiring/being cured; this is
                    called after onExpired/onCured are called, and is intended for any shared code you would want to run.
                </li>
            </ul><br />
            Each of these can take an array of callbacks to run when the event occurs.  At current, only two types
            of callbacks are supported:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Running a command: You may run a command by passing in an object that looks like the below<br />
                    <br />
                    <pre>{
    type: "runPlayerCommand",
    command: "/say @p You've got some extra luck.",
    name: "The Server"
}</pre><br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    Running a JavaScript function: You may also pass in a raw JavaScript function.  The functionality
                    for this is currently limited to logging, but will be expanded in a future release.
                    An example of this would be:<br />
                    <pre>function(entity, world) {
    console.log(entity.getName() + "'s luck expired.");
}</pre>

    <h2>Version 1.4.1</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding mob potion effect support, so that you can apply potion effects to mobs (and players) based on
            the matcher system.  By default, no mobs will have potion effects applied, and all effects have to be added
            using the 'addMobPotionEffect' operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'I:TicksBetweenPotionEffects' which determines the number of seconds

        </li>
        <li>

            The return of the Settings.cfg file; you can now set if the mod should log info about mob drop events,

    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to change harvest levels on blocks and tools using the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>remapHarvestLevel: Takes all blocks at a given harvest level and set them to another.</li>
                <li>setHarvestLevel: Sets the harvest level on a given block/with a given tool.</li>
                <li>setToolHarvestLevel: Changes the effective harvest level of a particular tool.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to change stats on TiCon tools using the following operations:

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to set harvest level names for new/existing TiCon harvest levels using the following:

            </ul>
        </li>

            "Unknown" until the player reaches a certain point in progression where they should be able to mine it;
            optionally combine this with setting harvest levels to ensure the player really doesn't mine it until
            after that point.
