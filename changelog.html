    <h2>Version 1.3.12</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding mob shedding support.  By default, no mobs will shed, and all sheds have to be added
            using the 'addMobShed' operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'I:SecondsBetweenSheds' which determines the number of seconds
            between the shed code running.  By default, this is 10 to help with TPS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding block drop controls, much like those used for mob drops; use the 'setBlockDrops' operation.  There's
            a dirty example in the default.json.sample file that shows multiple uses, including the new composite matchers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding new Settings.cfg entry 'B:LogMobDropEvents' which determines if block break events should be logged
            to help determine settings to use for the block drop controls.

        <li>
            Fixing <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/52">issue #52</a> where

            the fuzzy NBT check would fail when dealing with tag lists.  Still not perfect, as order of enchants matter.

            Adding ability to hide/show entries from JEI using the below commands, both of which can be used in

            <ul>
                <li>
                    hide: Hide an item/block from the JEI list; note that recipes that use the item, or make the item,
                    will still allow players to get to the item, so, if you really want to remove all signs of the item,
                    remember to remove the recipes as well.
                </li>
                <li>show: Show an item/block in the JEI list after it's been hidden</li>

            In addition, all spots which check if the attacker has a particular item have been updated to add the

            given mob), and can also be applied via custom sets.
        </li>
        <li>
            The return of the Settings.cfg file; you can now set if the mod should log info about mob drop events,

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Harvest level names can be applied with custom sets as well, so, you could leave a harvest level as
            "Unknown" until the player reaches a certain point in progression where they should be able to mine it;
            optionally combine this with setting harvest levels to ensure the player really doesn't mine it until
            after that point.
