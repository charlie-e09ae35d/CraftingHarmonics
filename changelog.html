    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Per <a href="https://github.com/legendblade/CraftingHarmonics/issues/34">request</a> added new setMobDrops
            operation to control what items mobs drop, will allow for:
            <ul>
                <li>Adding or removing a drop to a mob/set of mobs</li>
                <li>Replacing an entire drop table with your logic</li>
                <li>Replacements can exclude specific items (like Demonic Will from Blood Magic)</li>
            </ul><br />
            Each drop entry can individually specify:
            <ul>
                <li>Set chance of each drop entry separately</li>
                <li>Set quantity of each drop item betwen a min and max range</li>

                <li>Specify that the attacker has to be using a specific item to cause the drop</li>
            </ul><br />
            Additionally, drop tables can be overlaid on top of one another (ie: specify multiple tables affect a
            given mob), and can also be applied via custom sets.
        </li>
        <li>
            The return of the Settings.cfg file; you can now set if the mod should log info about mob drop events,
            so that you can better figure out entity names and damage types.

    <h2>Version 1.3.7</h2>
    <h4>Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to change harvest levels on blocks and tools using the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>remapHarvestLevel: Takes all blocks at a given harvest level and set them to another.</li>
                <li>setHarvestLevel: Sets the harvest level on a given block/with a given tool.</li>
                <li>setToolHarvestLevel: Changes the effective harvest level of a particular tool.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to change stats on TiCon tools using the following operations:
            <ul>
                <li>setMaterialStats: Modifies the stats for a given material.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding the ability to set harvest level names for new/existing TiCon harvest levels using the following:
            <ul>
                <li>setHarvestLevelName: Adds a new name for a harvest level or modifies an existing one.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Harvest level names can be applied with custom sets as well, so, you could leave a harvest level as
            "Unknown" until the player reaches a certain point in progression where they should be able to mine it;
            optionally combine this with setting harvest levels to ensure the player really doesn't mine it until
            after that point.
